# Final Project: Part 2 Audio

Think of your Audio Final Project as a conference research paper.
It does not have to be "an original contribution to the literature", but can be a report on what you design as a learning project for yourself.
You may have up to a maximum of 3 co-authors (projects evaluated accordingly).

The components should include:

* A paper with a clear statement of what you set out to explore
* a literature review of relevant papers
* a description of what you did (supporting figures welcome)
* and code that comes with a ~5 minute demo (video such as a screen grab with talk-over).

Just as a few suggestions for topics (meant to inspire, not to limit):

* Explore an architecture such as the transformer input representation, architectural features, sensitivity to data, conditioning. (Train if you have the resources)

* Find trainable DDSP or RAVE models, NoiseBandNet, etc. explore parameters (eg f threshold in RAVE SVD) or module components (e.g. positional encoding)

* Exploring Alternative Tokenization Strategies for Discrete Audio Codecs (DAC) Soundstream, Encodec bit rate efficiency, evaluation strategies, streaming capabilities. Can the Descript DAC stream?

* Latent Space Interpolation and Manipulation in RAVE for Timbre Morphing

* Push the creative potential of a generative audio network

## Deliverables

The final project deliverables are:

1. 4-5 page "conference" paper
2. A GitHub repository link containing the implementation code in the course Github Classroom.
3. A 5-minute video (like you would send to a conference) presenting your work including any demos.
